### How to help
Helping out is very easy once you understand the basics. We have full tutorials available on our website, as well as video tutorials: **[infiniteflightairportediting.github.io](http://infiniteflightairportediting.github.io/)**

**Please check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/InfiniteFlightAirportEditing/Airports/issues) before starting your airport. Make sure it isn't already in progress, and if it hasn't been started, please create a new issue with the name of the airport.**

We highly recommend you join our [Slack team](http://airportediting.slack.com) - it's a great way to meet other editors and get tips and tricks! Email <mailto:airports@liveflightapp.com> to get started.

### What to do / not to do

The general rule is "draw what you see", with a few exceptions:

**DO**<br>
* Use accurate imagery for airports.<br>
* Add taxiways.<br>
* Add taxiway lines.<br>
* Add parking spots.<br>
* Modify runways.<br>
* Add airport boundaries.<br>
* Add airport ATC frequencies (please see websites such as airnav.com for this).<br>

**DON'T**<br>
* Add runway markings with taxiway lines (this includes runway numbers, blastpad arrows, etc.).<br>
* Create jet bridges using the taxiway tool.<br>
* Forget to include a boundary.<br>
* Make up an airport - it **HAS** to be a real airport.<br>
* Outline buildings with a taxi line.<br>

### Airport accuracy

In order to achieve maximum accuracy for each airport (in terms of features drawn, location and sizing), the majority of our editors use [WED-O-Maker](https://wedomaker.wordpress.com). This allows for detailed satellite imagery to be shown on WED. It's free to use, and easy to set up (tutorials are available on the [WED-O-Maker](https://wedomaker.wordpress.com) website). We also use a software called [SASPlanet](http://www.sasgis.org), it is available only for PC. (download the [nightly](http://www.sasgis.org/download/) version, tutorials are available [here](http://bit.ly/SASPlanetGuide))
